# ChefBot - Recipe Generator Chatbot

ChefBot is an AI-powered recipe generator chatbot that assists users in generating recipes based on their provided ingredients or prompt. The bot utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate creative and engaging recipe ideas. With ChefBot, users can discover new dishes, find alternatives for specific ingredients, and even obtain nutritional information for their recipes.


## Features

- **Recipe Generation**: ChefBot can generate recipes based on user-provided ingredients or prompts. It uses the power of GPT-3.5 Turbo to create diverse and inventive recipes.

- **Content Moderation**: The bot incorporates content moderation to ensure that responses adhere to community guidelines. If a user input violates any predefined categories, ChefBot will provide a warning and explanation.

- **Ingredient Alternatives**: When a user indicates they lack a particular ingredient, ChefBot can suggest alternatives or modify the recipe to exclude the missing item.

- **Nutritional Information**: ChefBot can provide nutritional values for recipes upon user request, making it helpful for individuals with dietary preferences or restrictions.

- **Keyword Recognition**: ChefBot recognizes keywords like "veg," "non-veg," or "vegan" to tailor recipes to users' dietary preferences.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The bot employs a simple conversational interface, providing users with a seamless recipe generation experience.
